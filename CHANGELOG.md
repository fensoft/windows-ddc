# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The reconstruction audit covered the complete reachable repository history through `0b4f263`, all local and remote-tracking branches, and the live origin heads and tags before the documentation changes listed under Unreleased.

That audited history contains one parentless commit. The audit clone had no local tag ref, but origin advertised a lightweight `0.1.0` tag at the same commit as the then-current `master` and `origin/master`. Because a lightweight tag has no independent tagger timestamp, the version date below uses the tagged commit's committer date; the GitHub release was published shortly afterward on the same calendar date. There is no earlier release boundary or separate untagged development period to reconstruct.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added keyboard mnemonics, refresh shortcuts, slider boundary/page navigation, focusable controls, and descriptive volume button labels.
- Added release-history, architecture, and repository-agent documentation.
- Added hardware-free unit coverage for hook liveness, readiness loss, write failures, shutdown, and paired volume-key events.
- Added EDID/device-path monitor identity, display/device change notifications, error overlays, and hardware-free identity/settings/revalidation coverage.
- Added a persistent **Change speed** selector with Slow (`+1`), Medium (`+2`), and Fast (`+3`) choices for the GUI buttons and global volume keys.
- Added hardware-free tray acknowledgement, fallback, timeout, and Explorer-restart recovery coverage.
- Added hardware-free coverage for queued-callback containment, DDC watchdog behavior, bounded native-thread lifecycle waits, and shutdown diagnostics.
- Added a session-scoped Windows single-instance guard with hardware-free mutex, composition-root, and duplicate-restore coverage.
- Added Windows GitHub Actions CI across Python 3.10 and 3.14 for the hardware-free unit suite and all low-risk repository checks.
- Added bounded per-user rotating diagnostics for lifecycle, settings, native-subsystem, DDC, UI-callback, and shutdown failures, with isolated hardware-free coverage.
- Added an opt-in **Start with Windows** checkbox backed by the current-user Run key, with safe source/one-file command quoting, nonfatal error handling, and mocked registry coverage.
- Added a live tray menu with active monitor, confirmed volume, routing state, Refresh, stable-identity monitor switching, Restore, and Exit actions.

### Changed

- Apply Windows light/dark, system-color, and High Contrast changes live, and reflow the control window at its current DPI.
- Expanded user and operator documentation without changing runtime behavior.
- Place the volume/error overlay on the cursor's DPI-scaled Windows work area, fall back to the selected display when needed, and enforce native no-activate presentation.
- Made global Volume Down/Up interception require a live native hook and release subsequent presses after an uncertain DDC write result until Refresh succeeds.
- Kept the consume/pass-through decision stable from the first key-down through the matching key-up.
- Replaced description/ordinal persistence with backward-compatible schema-version-2 stable identity matching; missing or ambiguous targets now fail closed instead of selecting another monitor.
- Reacquire and exact-match fresh monitor wrappers before every actual DDC write, reject stale topology generations, and automatically rediscover after display changes or uncertain writes.
- Wait for confirmed tray-icon addition before withdrawing Tk, restore the main window on tray failures, and re-add visible icons after Explorer recreates the taskbar.
- Bound native listener startup and shutdown waits, keep Tk queue polling alive after individual callback failures, and report native threads that miss the shutdown deadline.
- Disable monitor control after a 10-second DDC watchdog timeout, retain the single-worker serialization slot until the native call returns, ignore its late result, and then perform read-only rediscovery.
- Reject duplicate launches before Tk or native initialization and ask the existing tray instance to restore its control window.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- DDC/CI monitor discovery and a refreshable selector, including ordinal disambiguation for monitors that report the same description.
- Audio-volume reads and clamped `0`–`100` writes with immediate hardware readback.
- A fixed-size Tkinter control window with a volume slider, percentage display, status bar, and one-point decrement/increment controls.
- Global Windows Volume Down and Volume Up interception that redirects ready-state key presses to the selected monitor while passing keys through before readiness.
- A topmost, translucent on-screen volume overlay that automatically hides after 1.4 seconds.
- Tray-first operation with startup minimization, double-click/menu restore, minimize-to-tray behavior, and an Exit action.
- Per-user selected-monitor persistence in `%APPDATA%\windows-ddc\settings.json`, with a home-directory fallback and temporary-file replacement.
- Windows light/dark application-theme detection, dark DWM title-bar support, and a shared application/tray icon.
- Background DDC/CI reads and serialized, coalesced rapid volume writes so blocking hardware access does not run on Tk's UI thread.
- Native Win32 tray and low-level keyboard-hook integration through `ctypes`.
- Python 3.10+ setuptools metadata with pinned `monitorcontrol==4.2.0` runtime and `Nuitka==2.4.8` build dependencies.
- A one-file, console-free Nuitka build for `dist\windows-ddc.exe`, including the Tk plugin and icon as both executable metadata and runtime data.
- The supported `app.py` launcher, an explicit exit-1 rejection stub in `main.py` that directs users to `app.py`, setup/build documentation, and tracked UI screenshots.
- A published `windows-ddc.exe` asset on the GitHub `0.1.0` release.
